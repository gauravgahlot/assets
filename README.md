# assets
A collection of CSS and JS that I generally use while working on web based projects.

## How to use?

 - CSS CDN: https://gitcdn.link/repo/gauravgahlot/assets/master/css/style.min.css
 - JS CDN: https://gitcdn.link/repo/gauravgahlot/assets/master/js/script.min.js

The CDN is generated using https://gitcdn.link/.

The original CSS and JS comes from the wonderful work at [BlackrockDigital
